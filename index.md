# Cyber Security Video

[![Cyber Security Video](https://img.youtube.com/vi/cnvUz_pInhw/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnvUz_pInhw)

In the video above I demonstrate a project that I had setup for a home SIEM lab that was created in Azure. I utilized Sentinel, created a honeypot, created a ubuntu server which host a MISP server to connect IOC data to sentinel, and created a workbook with failed RDP attempts coming from specific countries on a world map. This project was created with no knowledge to begin with and helped me increase my knowledge of how SOC analyst will use queries and such to draft incident management reports and how the systems notify us when something does happen on the network. I am eager to learn more and expand my knowledge as I know there are other SIEM programs that are utilized in other networks. I still have much to learn and am hoping in the future this project will demonstrate this fact. Thank you for taking the time to either read or watch my video.
